Here is my implementation of the test to be performed.

I comment some details for ease of testing:

- I share a google drive route that I will make public, so you can test the calls with POSTMAN as I have done. That is to say, I attach the collection of API calls.

- Since I was only asked to implement create, put, delete methods, I have added logger to the controller to be able to observe how the request is being treated.
- Also within the framework of the test, I have tried to use hexagonal architecture, very useful and important in spring.
